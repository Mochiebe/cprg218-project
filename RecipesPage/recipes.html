            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li> 2 cups strawberries, hulled and sliced</li>
                <li>1 cup grapes, halved</li>
                <li>2 kiwis, peeled and diced</li>
                <li>1 mango, peeled and diced</li>
                <li>1 cup pineapple chunks</li>
                <li>1 banana, sliced</li>
                <li>1 orange, peeled and segmented</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons honey</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice</li>
                <li>Fresh mint leaves for garnish</li>

                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine all the prepared fruits: strawberries, grapes, kiwis, mango, pineapple, banana, and orange segments.
                In a small bowl, whisk together the honey (if using) and lemon juice until well combined.
                Pour the honey-lemon mixture over the fruit and gently toss until the fruits are evenly coated.
                Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or transfer the fruit salad to an airtight container. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld and the fruit salad to chill.
                Before serving, give the fruit salad a gentle stir. Taste and adjust sweetness by adding more honey if desired.
                Garnish with fresh mint leaves for a burst of color and extra freshness.
                Serve chilled as a refreshing snack, side dish, or dessert.</p>

        <button class="accordion">1-Up Mushroom Soup</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
                <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
                <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>1 pound mushrooms, sliced</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>4 cups chicken or vegetable broth</li>
                <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
                <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
                <li>Chopped fresh parsley for garnish (optional)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <p>In a large pot or Dutch oven, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, and sauté until softened and fragrant, about 3-4 minutes.
                Add the sliced mushrooms to the pot and cook until they release their juices and become golden brown, about 5-6 minutes.
                Sprinkle the flour over the mushrooms and stir well to coat. Cook for another 2 minutes to cook off the raw flour taste.
                Gradually pour in the chicken or vegetable broth, stirring constantly to prevent lumps from forming. Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook for 8-10 minutes, or until slightly thickened.
                Reduce the heat to low and stir in the heavy cream. Simmer for an additional 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the soup is heated through and creamy.
                Season the soup with salt and pepper to taste. Adjust the seasoning as needed.
                Ladle the cream of mushroom soup into bowls and garnish with chopped fresh parsley if desired.
                Serve hot and enjoy!</p>

        <button class="accordion">Luigi Lasagna</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>9 lasagna noodles</li>
                <li>1 pound ground beef or Italian sausage</li>
                <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
                <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>1 (24-ounce) jar of marinara sauce</li>
                <li>1 (15-ounce) container ricotta cheese</li>
                <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
                <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
                <li>1 egg</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
                <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
                <li>Fresh basil leaves for garnish (optional)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray or butter.
                Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.
                In a large skillet, cook the ground beef or Italian sausage over medium heat until browned and cooked through. Drain any excess fat.
                Add the chopped onion and minced garlic to the skillet with the cooked meat. Sauté until the onion is softened and translucent, about 3-4 minutes.
                Stir in the marinara sauce and simmer for 5-10 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.
                In a mixing bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, 1 cup of shredded mozzarella cheese, grated Parmesan cheese, egg, dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and pepper. Mix well until fully combined.
                To assemble the lasagna, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Arrange 3 lasagna noodles on top of the sauce.
                Spread a layer of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles, followed by a layer of meat sauce. Repeat this layering process, ending with a layer of meat sauce on top.
                Sprinkle the remaining shredded mozzarella cheese over the top of the lasagna.
                Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes.
                Remove the foil and continue baking for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown.
                Let the lasagna cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.
                Garnish with fresh basil leaves if desired.</p>

        <button class="accordion">Princess Peach Cobbler</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h3>Ingredients</h3> 
            <ul>
                <li>4 cups sliced fresh or canned peaches (drained if canned)</li>
                <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
                <li>Pinch of salt</li>
                <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
                <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
                <li>Vanilla ice cream or whipped cream for serving (optional)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9x9-inch baking dish with butter or cooking spray.
                Spread the sliced peaches evenly in the bottom of the prepared baking dish.
                In a mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt until well combined.
                Pour the melted butter and milk into the dry ingredients. Stir until just combined, being careful not to overmix. The batter will be thick.
                Drop spoonfuls of the batter over the peaches, spreading it out as evenly as possible. It's okay if there are some gaps.
                Bake in the preheated oven for 35-40 minutes, or until the cobbler topping is golden brown and the peach filling is bubbly around the edges.
                Remove the peach cobbler from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving.
                Serve warm, topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream if desired.</p>
